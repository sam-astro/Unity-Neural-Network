# Unity-Neural-Network

## This is an outdated project
If you want the newest neural networks that I am working on now, then go to the new repository here: [https://github.com/sam-astro/NN-2](https://github.com/sam-astro/NN-2)
Otherwise, this project does still contain all of the experiments I did in the YouTube video with all of the games and walker, plus more.
